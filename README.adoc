= Kubernetes Applications Step-by-step

In this series of examples we will build a simple Python/Django based application
and deploy it on a Kubernetes cluster. 
We will go step-by-step and add Kubernetes components and learn about them
as we need them.

Here is what we are going to learn.

* Step Zero: build a simple Django application
** We will not _learn_ Django here. 
We will use Django as a platform because it's pretty easy to start with and (we hope) 
most of the developers these days can read and understand Python code.
At the same time this simple Django application is realistic enough to be a practical example.
* Step One: Create a single Pod
* Step Two: Create a ReplicaSet
* Step Three: Create a Deployment
* Step Four: Create a Service
* Step Five: Create an Ingress
* Step Six: Create a database Deployment
* Step Seven: Use ConfigMaps and Secrets
* Step Eight: Create a frontend web server and scale it up
* Step Nine: Create a StatefulSet for the database
